# Introduction
This is a simple proof-of-concept application for image compressionusing Angular, Electron and `imagemin` library. 

### Tech. Stack: 
- Angular v17.3.6
- Electron v30.0.1
- Angular Material v17.3.6
- Tailwind v3
- ngx-dropzone v17.3.0
- imagemin v7.0.1
- imagemin-pngquant v7.0.0

### Main Features: 
With this sample, you can:

- Select multiple images for compression using `ngx-dropzone` package
- Set a output directory config i.e. preserve original file directories, or set a custom directory for all files
- Configure PNG compression level used by `imagemin-pngquant` plugin
- Compress images locally for free using `imagemin` optimization
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

#### Possible Future Improvements:
- This was just a POC (proof-of-concept) application. It can be enhanced to include different types of images such as JPEG, SVG etc. 
- We can include multiple configuration options e.g. lossy, lossless, Color depth, dithering etc. For example, [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-pngquant) is a list of options available for PNG plugin. 
- This project uses Angular v17, but it can be upgraded to latest version for Angular, Electron and dependent.
